Hey prince. Myself Advitya. We need a basic website that describes about our hackathon. 

Let me explain you about the content we will be needing on our website:
1. Header with our Logo and navbar that will take us to different ids
2. ⁠A carousel with content or a poster about the event
3. ⁠Timeline using infographic
4. ⁠Prizepool using cards
5. ⁠Contact details and buttonsaround the entire webpage which will be redirecting to google forms.
6. ⁠Rules and Regulations
